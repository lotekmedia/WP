== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is link shadow for? =

<<<<<<< HEAD:Custom_Login/README.txt
Link shadow is the shadow around the links on the login page at the bottom.  It makes it hard to read depending on the background color you have selected, so I added a feature to turn it off if you need it.
With version 1.2.0, you can also select the link color and hover color to make it easier to use.
